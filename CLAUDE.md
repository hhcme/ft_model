# CAD Rendering Engine — Project Rules

## Project Overview

Self-developed 2D CAD rendering engine for parsing and rendering DWG/DXF files.
C++20 core engine with Canvas 2D / WebGL / Flutter rendering targets.
Commercial product — no GPL or copyleft dependencies.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Build (from project root)
cd build && cmake --build . --target render_export
cd build && cmake --build . --target cad_core

# Generate preview data from DXF
./build/core/test/render_export test_data/big.dxf test_data/big.json

# Serve Canvas 2D preview
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Open: http://localhost:8080/platforms/electron/preview.html?data=/test_data/big.json
```

## Architecture Rules

### Entity Model
- **Tagged union (std::variant)**, NOT virtual inheritance. No vtable overhead.
- Flat arrays, data-oriented design for cache-friendly traversal.
- EntityVariant indices are FIXED — do not reorder. New types append at end.
- `PolylineEntity` reused for both POLYLINE and LWPOLYLINE (indices 3 and 4).
- `CircleEntity` extended for ELLIPSE (index 12) with minor_radius, rotation, start/end_angle fields.

### Math Types
- All 3D types (Vec3, Matrix4x4, Bounds3d) — 2D is z=0 special case for future 3D extension.
- `math::PI`, `math::TWO_PI`, `math::DEG_TO_RAD` — use these, NOT `M_PI`.
- Matrix4x4 uses row-major storage (`m[4][4]`). `transform_point` is correct for CPU-side transforms.

### SceneGraph
- Owns ALL data. Everything else borrows references.
- Vertex buffer for polyline vertices — offset+count indexing.
- Layers, blocks, linetypes stored as vectors with name→index lookup.

### RenderBatcher
- Outputs `RenderBatch` with topology (LineList/LineStrip/TriangleList), color, vertex_data.
- **entity_starts**: For LineStrip batches, records vertex index where each entity starts. Essential for correct Canvas rendering (moveTo breaks between entities).
- **Transform pipeline**: `submit_entity` → `submit_entity_impl` with Matrix4x4 xform. INSERT block entities get composed transform applied during tessellation.
- Color resolution: entity ACI override (color_override != 256 && != 0) → layer color fallback.

### Block / INSERT Handling
- **Block definition entities must be filtered** when iterating — they are rendered ONLY through INSERT references with transforms applied.
- INSERT transform: `Matrix4x4::affine_2d(scale, rotation, translation)` composed with parent transform.
- Depth limit of 16 for recursive INSERT nesting.
- Some INSERT entities have corrupt parameters (extreme scale/insertion point). The MAD-based fitView handles these outliers.

## DXF Parsing Rules

- Each entity type has a dedicated `parse_*` method in `DxfEntitiesReader`.
- POLYLINE entities use VERTEX sub-entities followed by SEQEND — parser must consume the VERTEX loop.
- HATCH boundaries: polyline loops (path_type bit 2) AND edge-defined loops (bit 0) with line/arc edges.
- HATCH edge tessellation: line edges add endpoints directly; arc edges tessellate into segments.
- ELLIPSE: major axis endpoint (group 11/21) relative to center, minor/major ratio (group 40), parametric angles (41/42).
- When adding new entity types: add to EntityType enum, EntityVariant, DxfEntitiesReader dispatcher, RenderBatcher.

## Rendering Rules

- Linestrip batches MUST track `entity_starts` for path breaks between entities.
- Preview.html uses `batch.breaks` array to split linestrip rendering into per-entity sub-paths.
- Per-entity frustum culling: check first/last vertex against viewport with 50% margin.
- Dark color boost: brightness < 30 → boost to minimum 60 for dark background visibility.
- LOD: arc/circle segment count varies with zoom level via LodSelector.
- MAD-based fitView: samples 5000 vertices, uses median+MAD to find densest cluster, handles outlier coordinates.

## Coding Standards

- C++20 with std::variant. No virtual dispatch for entities.
- MIT/BSD third-party dependencies only.
- All math types in `cad_types.h` — extend there first.
- Header files use `#pragma once`.
- Namespace: `cad::`.
- Member variables: `m_` prefix.
- Include order: corresponding header → project headers → system headers.
- **No special-casing for specific test files.** All fixes must be general algorithmic/math improvements.

## Testing

- Use ezdxf (MIT) to generate test DXF files.
- Validate with `test_data/big.dxf` and `campus_masterplan.dxf` as real-world cases.
- Visual comparison against `test_dwg/big.png` reference image.
- Never commit test_data JSON files to git (they are in .gitignore).
